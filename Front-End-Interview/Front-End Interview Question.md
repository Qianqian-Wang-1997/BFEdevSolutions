#### [What are the time and space complexity for sorting algorithms](https://bigfrontend.dev/question/what-are-the-time-and-space-complexity-for-main-sorting-algorithms)

Time and Space complexity is a measurment of how a given algorithm performs as you increase the size of the input. Time Complexity measures how long an alogirthm runs in relation to the input, where as Space Complexity measures how much memory the algorithm will occupy. Many algorithms make a tradeoff between Time & Space complexity, so it is beneficial to have multiple solutions to utalize the one that works best for your problem Space

When discussing Tim & Space complexity, the context of the conversation means we normally don't care about the specific run time for a given input, but how that run time will change. Therefor we normally ignore coefficents and lower terms, and just assign the largest term. Therefor an algorithm with the Time complexity of O(5n^2 + n + 2), is normally represented as O(n^2)

Some popular sorting algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort & Radix Sort
