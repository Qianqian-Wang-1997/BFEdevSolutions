Iâ€™m consolidating a list of prep materials that helped me land the frontend engineer position at MANNG. There are tons of awesome resources out there. Below are the ones that I found extremely useful.

# Algorithms

[BFE.dev - prepare for Front-End job interviews.Practice Front-End coding problems,Prepare for job interviews,Get your dream offer. As a Front-End developerâ€¦bfe.dev](https://bfe.dev/)

Pretty much the only algorithm website that I used to prepare MANNG interviews. I also did LeetCode â€” most asked 100 questions. However, none of them was asked in my interview for frontend track.

# System design

^ This is my own channel. I am making them so I could learn by teaching. By preparing & recording the video, it gives me a chance to really know where I need to improve on.

Very good content. I binged on it.

^ I bought the frontend track so that I can have access to the behavior question content. It helped me understand how to organize my own story.

# Accessibility

[AccessibilityAllowing your pages to respond to different screen sizes is just one way of making sure your website is accessible toâ€¦web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/accessibility/)

# Others

[Glassdoor Job Search | You deserve a job that loves you backSearch millions of jobs and get the inside scoop on companies with employee reviews, personalized salary tools, andâ€¦www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)

Glassdoor is a great place where you can look up some recent questions. It is extremely important to do your due diligence before interviewing. Understanding the culture, products, interview process, what questions to expect etc.

# Negotiation service

I got multiple offers this time so I used levelsâ€™ negotiation service. I donâ€™t know if there is any better negotiation service out there. But Iâ€™m pretty happy with what I got in the end.

# In the end

I think interview is 50% luck and 50% practice and keep learning from your own mistakes. Out of the 10 companies that I interviewed this time, I failed 7 of them over the course of 4 weeks but I nailed last 3 companies in the last week.

I hope you will land your dream offer and look forward to you sharing with me about what helped you landed that dream offer.
